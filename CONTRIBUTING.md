# Contributing to Folding@home Containers

Contributions are always welcome. Things get better one patch at a time.

#### File Issue First

Any suggestions or bug reports should start with issue for tracking and
discussion. We want to know about bugs as soon as possible.
Features or changes should have discussion before work starts, so the work
will fit the overall goals and architecture of the containers.

Container issues: <https://github.com/foldingathome/containers/issues>

#### Release Cycle and Flow

We will do our best to follow stable, tested versions of Folding@home
software suitable for deployment.

Standard "fork and pull request" git workflow.

#### Commit Messages

All commit messages should follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) when possible.

#### Pull Request Scope & Method

Each pull request should address a single overall feature or bug if possible.
If the change requires documentation updates those should be in the SAME
pull request.
This makes reviews easier, rollbacks manageable, and the history clearer.

Merges will generally be done as "Squash and Merge" in most cases, so do not
worry about having multiple commits. Commit messages will get consolidated.

#### Formatting

* Clarity over brevity. Comments, use long command arguments, etc.
* Less than 80 columns whenever reasonable.
