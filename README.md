# Official Folding@home Containers

The official Folding@home containers are designed to be simple and run
in any container environment - desktop, laptop, Kubernetes, Helm,
Docker Compose, OpenShift, Cloud...

Containers track stable versions (2 weeks with no found bugs) of the
Folding@home Client. They will run on any Linux distribution, and are based
on LTS version of Ubuntu, OpenCL, and CUDA libraries. They contain enough
utilities to exec in and be able to debug any problems.

## Containers

* GPU container (NVIDIA) - [fah-gpu](fah-gpu/)
* GPU container (AMD) - [fah-gpu-amd](fah-gpu-amd/)

## Deployments

This repo will also contain Helm templates and other deployment
scripts/tools for a variety of environments.

## Folding@home Container Design Rules

* Containers will mount all read-write state, including config.xml
  which also has client state, into `/fah/`.
* Containerized clients will output to stdout/sterr for container logs.
* Containers are designed to be monitored via logs, and controlled with files.
* No example configurations will expose ports, and that functionality will
  be configured off in examples. Folding@home was built to run on
  desktops/LANs, and currently should not be exposed to the internet.

## Operating Containers

Each of these is explained in the container README, but they are included here
for clarity. RFC 2119 meanings.

* MUST mount read-writable persistent storage to `/fah` of the running
  container. Running containers MUST NOT share the same mounted directory,
  but directories SHOULD be reused to avoid lost Work Units.
* MUST create and preload a tuned `config.xml` in each persistent
  storage directory before running the container for the first time.
* MUST run the container as a uid:gid, specified with with `--user` or
  equivalent, so that the running container has read-write permissions to
  the persistent storage in `/fah`.
* SHOULD NOT run containers as root.
* SHOULD NOT expose ports to internet without firewall rules, encryption, and
  strong passwords.

## Tags

The client versioning is not yet _strict_
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), so currently the tags used are:

* `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` - follows stable Folding@home Client version.
* `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc...` - test builds of the containers, stable clients.
* `latest` - please never use latest in production, specify a version. Points
  at the latest released container.

Once SemVer is strictly followed, the familiar `MAJOR`, `MAJOR.MINOR`, and
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags will be created.
